		 *  The composition is a design technique in which your class can have an instance of another class 
		 *  as a field of your class. Inheritance is a mechanism under which one object can acquire 
		 *  the properties and behavior of the parent object by extending a class.

			In inheritance there is “is-a” relationship, in composition there is “has-a” relationship. 
			In Inheritance, a class lass can extend only one interface, therefore, you can reuse your code only in one class only
			We can reuse code in multiple class
			Inheritance provides its features at compile time
			Composition is easily achieved at runtime
			We can’t reuse code from the final class
			It allows code reuse even from final classes
			It exposes both public and protected method of the parent class
			It doesn’t expose. They interact using public interface.
