		 * Aggregation is a special form of association. It is a relationship between two classes 
		 * like association, however its a directional association, which means it is strictly 
		 * a one way association. It represents a HAS-A relationship.
		 * For example, consider two classes Student class and Address class. 
		 * Every student has an address so the relationship between student and address is a Has-A relationship.
		 * But if you consider its vice versa then it would not make any sense as an Address doesnâ€™t need 
		 * to have a Student necessarily.
		 * It is used to maintain code re-usability
