	 * The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

       declare class variables/attributes as private
       provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable
	 *

	 * encapsulation is to hide the implementation details from users. 
	 * If a data member is private it means it can only be accessed within the same class. 
	 * No outside class can access private data member (variable) of other class.
